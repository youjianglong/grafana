# Whatâ€™s new in Grafana v7.5

> **Note:** This is content for a beta version of Grafana. It will be updated several times before the stable release.

This topic includes the release notes for Grafana v7.5. For all details, read the full [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Grafana OSS features

These features are included in the Grafana open source edition.

### Pie chart panel visualization (beta)

Grafana 7.5 adds a beta version of the next-gen pie chart panel.

### Alerting for Loki

Grafana 7.5 comes with alerting support for Loki. With LogQL you can wrap a log query with the functions that allow for creating metrics out of the logs, such as "rate()". Metric queries can then be used to calculate things such as the rate of error messages. [When combined with log parsers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9z2V0Ib1q0), they can be used to calculate metrics from a value within the log line, such latency or request size.

With alerting support for Loki, you can now create alerts on Loki metrics queries. Alert rules can be set up easily in the graph panel and you can learn more about the process of creating alerts in the Alert documentation.

### Loki label browser

A new Loki logs browser lets you construct the queries step by step: you choose labels that you like to consider, such as "job", then you select the values that you like, such as "my-app1". Note that you can select values from more than one label, and that they get facetted. This means only possible label combinations are selectable. When you're done, you can run the query either as a logs or a metrics query (a metrics query returns the log volume in a chart).

### Changed default HTTP method for new Prometheus data sources

For new Prometheus data sources, we have changed the default HTTP method to POST. POST allows for much larger query bodies than using the GET method. This is necessary when sending queries from graphs with a lot of targets, for example, many hosts in a dashboard variable. The POST method also makes the Query Inspector data easier to read since the query is in plain text whereas the GET query is URL encoded.

> **Note:** This is not going to affect provisioned data sources or already created data sources.

### Word highlighting for Elasticsearch

When searching for text in Elasticsearch logs, matching words in the log line returned by the query are now highlighted.

### Better format definition for trace data

In Grafana 7.5, we changed how data for the trace view is sent from the data source. The required data frame has a clear format, which is more aligned with how data is generally represented in Grafana. This makes it easier for third-party developers to implement data sources leveraging the trace view.

### Paste in SSL certs for Postgres data source

Previously, when users wanted to configure the Postgres data source to connect with SSL certification, they needed to put the certification on the server, and configure the data source with file path.

Instead of the file path, users can now paste the SSL certification content in the UI. This allows them to configure the certification even when they do not have access to the server.

> **Note:** It remains as limitation for the hosted Grafana, because the user doesn't have access to the server configuration.

### Deprecation notice for some Azure Monitor queries 

In the upcoming Grafana 8.0 release, Application Insights and Insights Analytics query types within the Azure Monitor data source will be deprecated and be made read-only in favor of querying Application Insights from Metrics and Logs. 

Grafana 7.5 includes a deprecation notice for these queries, and some documentation to help users prepare for the upcoming changes.

For more information refer to [Deprecating Application Insights and Insights Analytics]({{< relref "../datasources/azuremonitor.md#deprecating-application-insights-and-insights-analytics" >}}).

## Enterprise features

These features are included in the Grafana Enterprise edition.

### Active user limits

If a Grafana instance has exceeded its licensed number of active users, then non-active users who try to sign in to Grafana will be prevented from doing so. Active users are users who have logged in to Grafana in the past 30 days. The total number of users registered in Grafana does not affect this rule. This enforcement is applied separately for Viewers and for Editor/Admins, so if you reach your active Viewer limit, new Editor/Admins will still be able to sign in. This rule also includes a 10% buffer, meaning that you need to exceed your limit by 10% before users are prevented from signing in.

Here is an example:

A Grafana Enterprise instance includes 100 Viewers and 50 Editor/Admins. Over the course of the last 30 days, 110 Viewers and 20 Editor/Admins have signed in to Grafana.

All of the Viewers who have signed in over the past 30 days will retain the ability to sign in.

When a previously-inactive Viewer (someone who has not signed in over the past 30 days) tries to sign in, they will see a message and be prevented from signing in until the number of active users dips back below 110. New Editor/Admins are not affected by this; they can continue to sign in until the number of active Editors/Admins reaches 55.

If you try to sign in to a fourth device or browser, then you will be prevented from doing so; the limit of concurrent sessions is three.

If you sign in to a fourth device or browser, then you will be signed out of the session that is least current.
Concurrent session limits
Each Grafana Enterprise user will be limited to three concurrent user sessions. When a user opens a fourth session, then the longest-inactive session will be automatically signed out.

A new session is created when you sign in to Grafana from a different device or a different browser. Multiple windows and tabs in the same browser are all part of the same session, so having many Grafana tabs open will not cause any issues.

For more information on Grafana Enterprise licensing and restrictions, refer to [License restrictions]({{< relref "../enterprise/license-restrictions.md" >}}).

### Query caching

If you enable this feature, then Grafana hashes and cashes data source queries and serves cached versions of hashed queries if applicable.

### Use template variable in reports

If you enable the feature, then you can use template variables in reports.

## Breaking changes

There are no known breaking changes in this release.

## Updated configuration

```
[server]
read_timeout = 0
```

Sets the maximum time using a duration format (5s/5m/5ms) before timing out read of an incoming request and closing idle connections.
`0` means there is no timeout for reading the request.
